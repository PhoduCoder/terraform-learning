#
This is a sample README for my Terraform learning
once you have the AWS creds configured on your system
where you have terraform installed
you can then run these commands in this order

# To format the TF file recursively
terraform fmt -recursive

# To initialize Terraform
terraform init

# To look at what will terraform be creating
terraform plan 

# To finally apply the terraform scripts
terraform apply
